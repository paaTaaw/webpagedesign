# Roadway Management System
The Roadway Management System is a project that is both educational and entertaining.
It is primarily targeted towards tourists, both domestic and international.
This management system gives you all the information you need about the place you're planning to visit/travel to/hike to, and so on.
It informs travellers on the state of the road, necessary facilities such as motels, gas stations, and petrol pumps, as well as other necessary resources.
Aside from that, suggestions are offered for visitors to try out on their journey to their destinations.
